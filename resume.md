### Research & Projects

__New York University__ </br> <span>*May 2013 - Present*</span>
:   __Studying cosmological large scale structure in the clustering statistics of galaxies (with Prof. Jeremy Tinker)__

    - *Skills:* MCMC, Bayesian inference, mathematical modeling and numerical simulation, large datasets, parallel computing
    - Projects involving statistical modeling of galaxy data from the largest volume survey made to date (SDSS) as part of a large scientific collaboration (1000s of researchers), in order to understand the underlying dark matter structure and how it affects the galaxy distribution in the universe
    - *Achievements:* Made scientific-grade measurements and analysis for several papers, presented findings at conferences across USA, mentored student researchers
    - *Tools:* python (scipy, cython, emcee, matplotlib...), C, Linux, bash, vim, MPI, SQL

__Various Locations__ </br> <span>*2012 - Present*</span>
:   __Data-hacking projects__

    - Participated (in groups and alone) in several hackathons and did classwork and personal projects with diverse datasets (astronomy, web, NYC public, financial, hardware sensors) to study trends and to understand and test novel techniques and models
    - *Skills:* Data-mining, statistical modeling, machine learning, data visualisation, financial modeling, deep learning, project presentation
    - *Tools:* python, javascript, julia, R, SQL, Hadoop, AWS, MongoDB, arduino, raspberry pi, and more, generally stay current on developments in tech tools

__New York University__ </br> <span>*Mar 2012 - Aug 2013*</span>
:   __Probabilistic Sky Catalogue (with Prof. David Hogg)__

    - Modeling crowdsourced astronomical images with tools from <a href="http://astrometry.net/">`astrometry.net`</a> and <a href="http://thetractor.org/">`thetractor.org`</a> to build a probabilistic catalogue of astronomical objects from 100k+ images
    - *Skills:* Statistical modeling, programming, data mining and analysis, model selection, data visualisation

__University of Aarhus, Denmark__ </br> <span>*Sep 2010 - Jan 2011*</span>
:   __Asteroseismology thesis project (with Prof. Jørgen Christensen-Dalsgaard)__

    - *Skills:* Numerical simulation, data analysis of simulation output using IDL, comparison with physical models of stellar seismic behaviour, presentation
    - Research resulted in important corrections to widely-used simulation code and secured an excellent grade in my final thesis

__UC Santa Barbara, California__ </br> <span>*Jun 2010 - Sep 2010*</span>
:   __Studying structure and function of Proteorhodopsin__

    - *Skills:* lab skills for genetic mutation and expression of proteins, monitoring/verifying samples, electron paramagnetic resonance with MRI and signal analysis, communication skills for shared lab resources and presentations
    - This project was done as part of a competitive research experience funded by Biomedical Diagnostics Institute in Dublin City University, Ireland
